I protect the wishing well and help travelers making their wish.

Hello young traveler, what can I help you with?
Magic? from the wishing well?
I suppose that won't cause any harm to the magic inside the well...
But you won't be able to make a wish ever again.
Is that worth it to you?
If it is, then let me help you grant your wish.
There you go. Your wand now contains magic.
I trust you will only serve the light with it.

Hello.
