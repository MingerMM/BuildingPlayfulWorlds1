Hello there, you look like a nice one.
I bet you don't have any clue what you've got to do, do you?
You just appeared in this weird place...
Actually, I have something to do for you, as you might have guessed.
Could you help me with something?
I need some help with some magic you see...
Don't worry, it's not black magic... 
Let's uhm... Call it greyish for now, eh?
First, I need a wand. You can make one from the gigangtic tree over there.

You can use an axe to chop the tree so you can make a wand from it.

Yes! Very well! Now, secondly we have to... 
Well, actually you have to, since the fairy doesn't like me very much...
Convince the fairy you have to absorb some magic from the wishing well.
It won't do any harm to the well...
You only won't ever be able to make a wish anymore,
but I assure you, this is going to be worth it! You'll have an actual working wand!

Wauw, you actually did it!
You're a real nice one!
Now you'll be able to bring this place to life...
Come on, don't be shy. Cast some flowers!
